             My name is Kolten Bergeron. I am a front end developer and designer.
             I currently attend Texas A&M University where I'm majoring in University Studies Architecture with
             a minor in Computer Science and a minor in Art (new media emphasis).
         </p>
         <p>
             I prefer simple design & programming solutions that do not take away
             from the intended result. This approach is applied to all of my work.
